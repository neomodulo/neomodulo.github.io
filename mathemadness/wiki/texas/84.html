			<h2> TI-84 Plus Series </h2>
			<h3> TI-84 Plus</h3>
			<p> 
				The TI-84 Plus is the most popular calculator that Texas Instruments sells. Released in 2004 as a follow-up to the <a href="83.html">TI-83 Plus,</a> it introduced MathPrint, a since staple feature that shows certain mathematical symbols in a friendlier textbook-like manner. It also introduced a real-time clock and shipped with new Flash Apps. These apps could also be downloaded onto the TI-83 Plus. Confusingly, there is no "regular TI-84" or "TI-84 non-plus" model.

			</p>
			<br>
			<h3> TI-84 Plus Silver Edition</h3>
			<p>Also in 2004, the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition was introduced, giving a generous 1.5MB of Flash and a new chassis that comes in a variety of colors. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition </h3>
			<p> 
				To experiment with color screens on their main-line calculators, Texas Instruments released the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition in 2013. To put it simply, it's an 84 Plus with a color screen, a rechargable battery to compensate for said screen, and an increase to 3.5MB of Flash. The OS has also been modified to handle the new screen type, allowing the user to graph over pictures from a computer, and graph in different colors.<br><br>
				
				The issues arise with the fact that the 15MHz Z80 used here is not fast enough to handle drawing to this new screen. Worse still, the new OS and display means it is not natively compatible with older TI-84 Plus applications. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3> TI-84 Plus CE </h3>
			<p> 
				In response to the lukewarm reception of the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, TI released the TI-84 Plus CE in 2015. It did not fix compatibility with older TI-84 Plus models, but rather, made it into a new platform, with much better performance and a slimmer design. It kept the sharp color screen and rechargable battery from the C Silver Edition, but now uses the Zilog eZ80 in order to achieve a higher clock speed.<br><br>
				As a result of the CE's popularity, the community at <a href="https://cemetech.net" target=blank>Cemetech</a> is now home to a new programming revolution for this calculator, just like its predecessors. There are many unofficial toolchains and languages you can use to make your own programs for the CE. However, TI no longer officially supports this use case, so exploits in the OS are once again required to run them.
			</p>
			<h4>Python Edition</h4>
			<p>
				In 2021, TI updated the TI-84 Plus CE to include support for the Python programming language. It uses an ARM co-processor and a Flash App to handle this.
