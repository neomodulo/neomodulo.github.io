			<h2> TI-85 </h2>
			<p> 
			The TI-85 is one of two follow-ups to the <a href="81.html"> TI-81.</a> It started a small line of calculators that were more geared towards engineering and higher-level math. The only other calculator in this line is the <a href="86.html">TI-86.</a> These calculators also sport an odd resolution of 128x64, making the pixels and text noticably skinner.<br><br>
			It also started a calculator programming revolution thanks to the addition of a 2.5mm serial connector. This could be used to connect calculators to each other, to transfer variables and BASIC programs, but also to a computer. <br> <br> 
			Using this, the community eventually found an exploit in the 85's OS, allowing it to run assembly language programs. This spike in popularity of writing software for their calculators likely caused assembly to be easily available in later models.
