			<h2> TI-81 </h2>
			<p> 
				Introduced in 1990, the TI-81 was Texas Instruments' first graphing calculator. It wasn't the first on the market, however. That honor goes to Casio's fx-7000G, having been released 4 years earlier. As well as competing with Casio, it also served as a follow-up to TI's line of pocket computers, offering similar functionality at a lower price and size. <br><br>It's remarkable how little has changed from this time-tested design. It features Parametric and Standard graphing, matricies, all while being a very competent scientific calculator. It does all this with the "Equation Operating System", which, while heavily modified, is still in use on modern TI graphing calculators.
