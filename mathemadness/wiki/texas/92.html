			<h2> The TI-92 series and Voyage 200</h2>
				<p> The TI-92 series is most well known for its Computer Algebra System, or CAS, which allows it to handle symbolic representation. It has been notoriously labelled as a "computer" by many American testing boards, and can't be used on standardized tests. The 92s specifically are also notable for being user-upgradable with more memory and Flash ROM, and being the first of TI's to support 3D graphing. </p>
				<h3> Hardware Revisions </h3>
				<p> In 1995, the original TI-92 released. This would be the base model that future 68k's would expand on, in two forms- modules, and seperate units.<br><br>
				This would first be seen with the TI-92 II, in 1996. It increased the memory to 128KB, and added support for 5 new languages - English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. The new OS that contained these languages as well as extra RAM was also available as a module you could insert into your existing TI-92.<br><br>
				In 1998, along with a much improved screen similar to the newly released <a href="83.html">TI-83 Plus,</a> the ram was increased again to 188KB, and 720KB of rewritable flash was added, also known as the "archive." Like the 92 II, it was also available as a module which added the extra RAM and flash, along with a new OS to support these additions.<br><br>
				In 2002, the updated Voyage 200 was released, which gave it a well-deserved, thinner redesign, as well as a whopping 2.7MB of flash.</p>
