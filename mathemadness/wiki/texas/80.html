			<h2> TI-80 </h2>
			<p> 
				The TI-80 was a cost-reduced version of the TI-81 for the middle-school market. Released in 1995, It cut down the screen size and was considerably slower, but still managed to retain a lot of a TI-81's identity. It was succeeded by the <a href="73.html">TI-73 series.</a><br><br>
				While it is grouped in with the other Z80-based TI calculators, it instead uses a Toshiba T6M53. As such, there's little to no Assembly community for the TI-80. The only hardware improvement over the TI-81 was it's 7K of RAM over 2.4KB. It also lifted some software limits because of that increase in memory, like allowing up to 37 programs in TI-BASIC. The OS also has support for fractions and some unit conversion.
