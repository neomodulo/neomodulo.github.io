			<h2> TI-82 </h2>
			<p> 
				After the engineering focused <a href="85.html">TI-85,</a> TI went back to basics succeeding the <a href="81.html">TI-81</a> in 1993. It features specifications more in-line with later models, introducing a new SoC allowing the calculator to reach a clock speed of 6MHz. The RAM was also dramatically increased to make room for the most useful addition; the link port. It allowed users to transfer programs and variables to other calculators or from a computer. This, along with the TI-85 before it, brought in a wave of programmers making unofficial games and other tools. <br><br>
				There were three later models of TI-82. In 1999, it was refreshed with the same casing style as the recently released <a href="83.html">TI-83.</a> It was also given a price-cut so as to not compete with it. In 2000, the case was changed again for the TI-82 "Parcus", which was given a further price cut. Finally, the TI-82 line was completed in 2004 with the TI-82 Stats; a blue TI-82 Parcus with an OS upgrade, giving it very similar functionality to the TI-83. This model was first introduced in France, but was later sold to other European countries.<br><br>
