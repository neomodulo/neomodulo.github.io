			<h2> TI-83 Series </h2>
			<h3> TI-83 </h3>
				<p> The TI-83 was released in 1996 as a follow-up to the <a href="82.html"> TI-82. </a> It introduced a slew of new graphing modes, having polar, parametric, and sequence graphing, and a much improved TI-Basic. <br> <br>
			<h3> TI-83 Plus </h3>
				In 1999, the TI-83 Plus was introduced, adding 160KB of rewritable flash memory, (dubbed "Archive Memory"), and provided less RAM due to address space limitations. This is the best selling 83 model, and the last still being sold in the lineup. <br> <br>

			<h3> TI-83 Plus Silver Edition </h3>
				Finally, in 2001, the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was released, and quickly discontinued. It featured a 3x boost in clock speed, almost 10x the amount of flash memory, and over 4x more RAM. However, most of the extra RAM was not available to the user. It also featured a silver transluscent case with glitter.
