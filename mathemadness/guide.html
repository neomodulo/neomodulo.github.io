			<h1> Graphing Calculator Buyer's Guide (Written Version) </h1>
			<p>
				The fall semester is coming soon, and if you need a graphing calculator, there’s quite a few options to choose from. This guide will cover the current offerings from Texas Instruments and Casio in the United States, and a few honorable mentions.
				
				<p> If you'd prefer, we've made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fT_fALm_jE&t=1s" target=blank> video version of this guide as well. </a></p>
				
				You should ask yourself, however, do you even need a graphing calculator?
				Scientific and financial calculators have gotten considerably more advanced over the years, and the functionality gap between them shrinks with every new model.<br>
				<h3>If you need the following features: </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Graphing (of course)</li>
					<li>Running and creating advanced user programs</li>
					<li>Solving linear equations larger than degree three</li>
					<li>Solving advanced algebraic equations (Using a Computer Algebra System)</li>
					
				</ul>
				Then a graphing calculator is your best option. Otherwise, consider purchasing a TI-36X Pro or Casio FX-991EX. They're the most advanced scientific calculators of their respective brands, but are offered at a much cheaper price.<br><br>
				<b>Note:</b> Some calculators may have links as their titles, meaning they have a dedicated page on MATHEMADNESS. It'd be a good idea to read them if you're interested in their finer details.
			</p>
			<h2 id="texasinst">Texas Instruments</h2>
			<h3 id="73"><a href="wiki/texas/73.html">TI-73 Explorer</a></h3>
			<p>
				The TI-73 Explorer is a more basic model to introduce middle school students to graphing. It has some unique graph types like bar graphs and pie charts for more visual learning, as well as easier access to fractions and unit conversion.<br><br>
				However most of these features can be found on scientific calculators these days. Compared to other graphing calculators, it is rather lacking. As such, if you intend to keep it for a while, you’ll be stuck when you need to use complex numbers or matrices. If the price is attractive to you, Consider Casio’s calculators, which will be covered later.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="83-4"><a href="wiki/texas/83.html">TI-83 Plus</a>, <a href="wiki/texas/84.html">TI-84 Plus</a>, and <a href="wiki/texas/84.html">TI-84 Plus CE</a></h3>
			<p>
				The TI-83 Plus, 84 Plus, and 84 Plus CE are essentially different versions of the same product. All of them are very common in the US, and make for a safe, reliable option. They also all have a huge library of downloadable applications and games, both official and unofficial.<br><br>

				Most people can get by with the cheaper 83 Plus, but one notable feature is MathPrint. This was introduced with the 84 Plus and it allows elements like fractions and exponents to be displayed in a friendlier manner. Whether or not this is worth the extra money is up to you.<br><br>
				
				<img src="wiki/assets/mathprint.png" width=675px alt="No MathPrint (TI-83 Plus) vs. MathPrint (TI-84 Plus CE)"><br><br>
				
				The TI-84 Plus CE introduces a sharper, color screen, better performance, and a rechargeable battery. These aren’t necessary features, of course, but they act as nice bonuses that make for an overall smoother experience. The latest models are even programmable in Python, in addition to TI-BASIC.
				<br><br>
			</p>

			<h3 id="89"><a href="wiki/texas/89.html">TI-89 Titanium</a></h3>
			<p>
				This is the most basic calculator TI sells with CAS. A CAS, or Computer Algebra System allows a calculator to handle variables as unknown values. This allows it to solve or factor equations, for example. For more information, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" target=none>Wikipedia article about it.</a><br><br>
				
				The trade-off is that it’s not allowed in some exams or classes. As of July 2022, calculators with CAS are allowed on the SAT and some AP exams, but not ACT or IB exams. When you can use it, a CAS is extremely useful in higher-level classes where plain Algebra starts to become tedious.<br><br>
				
				Aside from that, though, it has other noticeable improvements from the 84 series, like 3D graphing, split screen, more storage, and faster operation. The screen isn’t backlit, but is still sharper than the 84’s. This is a pretty reasonable compromise, as it allows for better readability while maintaining long battery life.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="nspire">TI-Nspire CX II and CX II CAS</h3>
			<p>
				The Nspire series is TI’s most premium calculator lineup. As the names imply, there are models with and without a CAS.<br><br>

				Like the TI-89 Titanium, the CAS version is not allowed on ACT and IB exams, but we'd reccomend it anyway, since you can disable it on this model with its Exam Mode. A good number of common commands you wouldn’t think require CAS, somehow do.<br><br>

				The somewhat confusing UI is the Nspire’s biggest weakness. It's driven by a small touchpad, similar to a laptop, which also acts as a set of arrow keys. If you're unsure about this, <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/a78091cd540843d68ab8ee5853c84828/student-nspirecx" target=blank>try out the TI-Nspire Student Software.</a> It has a free 14-day trial, so you can decide how you feel about the unorthodox layout. Keep in mind, though, it may feel better on a real keyboard and mouse than on a tiny keypad.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 id="casio">Casio</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately, Casio isn’t as popular of a brand in the US, so your teacher may not be familiar with them, or might just require a TI. If you can work with them, though, the value of these calculators are second to none.</p>

			</p>
			
			<h3 id="9750">fx-9750GIII</h3>
			<p>
				At the low end is the fx-9750G3. It competes with the TI-84 Plus, despite being the least expensive graphing calculator right now. Sometimes, it even manages to embarrass the likes of the TI-84 Plus CE, and it includes Python as icing on the cake.<br><br>
				
				You may also see different models with additional letters, like "WE", or "PK". These are only color codes, and do not indicate any technical changes.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="prizm">fx-CG50 PRIZM</h3>
			<p>
				The CG50 is Casio's equivalent to TI's 84 Plus CE. Similarly, it's an upgrade of the 9750GIII with a sharp, color screen, a rechargable battery, and better performance. It also has some more premium features, like 3D graphing, and a wider array of downloadable applets, for now.

			</p>
			<h3 id="classpad">fx-CG500 PRIZM CAS</h3>
			<p>
				Despite the name, this is not related to the CG-50 Prizm. Rather, it's a continuation of the Casio Classpad line, Casio's most premium calculator and competitor to the TI-Nspire. <br><br>Like the Nspire, it's bit closer to a computer than a calculator. It uses a touch-based interface that requires the use of an on-screen keyboard for most actions. This is the only calculator with a CAS that Casio still sells.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 id="hm">Honorable Mentions</h2>
			<h3 id="prime">HP Prime (2nd generation)</h3>
			<p>
				If the previous CAS calculators aren’t for you, the HP Prime might pique your interest. It offers a more comfortable style of input while still giving the interactive benefits of a touch screen and CAS. HP also offers an emulator for iOS, Android, and Windows- so, depending on your use case, you may not even need the physical device. <br><br>

			</p>
			<h3 id="numworks"><a href="wiki/numworks.html">Numworks</a></h3>
			<p>
				The Numworks N0110 calculator promised to be a more open calculator, free for hobbyists and tinkerers to do as they please. Disappointingly, however, Numworks has disabled the ability to install custom firmware on it, to appease exam boards. Jailbreaks such as Phi do exist, but for many, Numworks has officially taken away what made this calculator so promising. <br><br>
				Aside from that, it is still a solid color calculator if you already own it, though it doesn’t offer much that other competitors don’t.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="zero">Zero Calculator</h3>
			<p>
				As of July 2022, this calculator hasn’t been released yet, and information on the product itself is increasingly slim. Based on the few posts on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zerocalculators/" target=blank> their Instagram, </a> it appears to be a clone of the TI-84 Plus CE, almost to the point of questionable legality. This could be why the company behind it is so hesitant to show it off. <br><br>

				If, by chance, the calculator has been released by the time you watch this video, be sure to at least give it a look. If you’d like a compilation of everything we know about Zero Calculators right now, check out the videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TInyHackerCalcs/" target=blank>Tiny_Hacker</a> on the subject.<br><br>
