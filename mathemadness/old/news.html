		<h3> TI-84 Plus CE Python Announced! • 6 May 2021 </h3>
		<p> After 6 years, Texas Instruments has finally brought Python to the 84 Plus CE <b>without</b> the use of the defunct Python module. On their <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plus-ce-python" target=none> American site </a> this time! Alongside the French 82 Advanced Edition Python, it will be available in Fall of 2021. On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COdZ4JPtKkf/" target=none> TI's instagram, </a> We can see what appears to be a live demo of Python drawing text to the screen as a neat Star Wars reference, along with a brand new peach-like color, and a lavender color! The specifications appear to be the same as the normal, later-made CEs, and the 83 Premium CE. <br><br>

		<h3> z80nline: a new Web-based 83/84+ simulator • 18 December 2020 </h3>
		<p> We here at MATHEMADNESS are starting a new project to make our site more interactive. A way to experience the TI-83 and 84 calculators for free, built from the ground up. <br>
		<a href="z80nline/index.html" target=none> You can find the testing page here to play with.</a> &nbsp;Eventually, this will be integrated into a Basic Tutoring section here!</p>
		
		
		<h3> <a href=https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/ target=none> arTIfiCE</a> opens up Asm support after TI lockout • 29 October 2020 </h3>
		<p> In TI's latest OS update for the 84 Plus CE and it's variants, support for unsigned programs written in eZ80 Assembly was removed. <br> <br>
		However, a jailbreak arose just a few months later known as arTIfiCE! The jailbreak works by using a flaw in TI's Cabri Jr. Flash App, which work similarly to Asm programs, and can install launchers like Cesium into the apps menu without being signed. Huzzah! <br>
		<a href=https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/ target=none> Visit arTIfiCE's website</a>  to find out how to install it for yourself. Happy programming!</p>
